# AWS Cloud & Security Projects 🚀

Hands-on cloud infrastructure and security projects built on AWS,
focused on real-world architectures, networking, and monitoring.

## 🔧 Skills & Tools
- AWS: EC2, VPC, IAM, CloudWatch, SNS
- Networking: Subnets, Route Tables, NAT Gateway, Bastion Host, VPC Peering
- Security: Least privilege IAM, private networking
- OS: Linux (SSH, permissions, basic troubleshooting)

## 📁 Projects

### 1️⃣ Secure Multi-Tier VPC Architecture
- Designed a VPC with public and private subnets
- Implemented Bastion Host for secure SSH access
- Configured NAT Gateway for outbound internet access
- Applied least-privilege Security Groups
📂 Folder: `01-secure-vpc-architecture`

### 2️⃣ VPC Peering & Private EC2 Communication
- Created two isolated VPCs
- Enabled cross-VPC communication using VPC Peering
- Accessed private EC2 without public IPs
📂 Folder: `02-vpc-peering`

### 3️⃣ EC2 Monitoring with CloudWatch
- Monitored EC2 CPU utilization
- Created CloudWatch alarms
- Understood default AWS metrics
📂 Folder: `03-ec2-monitoring-cloudwatch`

### 4️⃣ IAM Role-Based Security
- Implemented IAM roles instead of access keys
- Applied least-privilege policies
📂 Folder: `04-iam-security-hardening`
